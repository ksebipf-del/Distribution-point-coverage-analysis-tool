A QGIS plugin to analyse and improve the spatial coverage of humanitarian and development distribution networks.

The tool combines distribution point locations, WorldPop population data, and planning area boundaries to calculate population coverage, highlight underserved areas, and suggest improved or new distribution point locations.It can be used to optimise existing networks or to design a new distribution network from scratch by uploading an empty CSV file.
